Adds a "Layout" option to your Product Bundles, which can be used to activate a table-based layout, similar to the one found in Grouped Products.

== Description ==

[Product Bundles](http://www.woothemes.com/products/product-bundles//) is an official [WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) extension suitable for creating simple product packages: With Bundles you can quickly build complex products and create bulk discount combos by mixing simple and variable products. Downloadable and virtual products are also supported, while Product Bundles support many popular WooCommerce extensions, such as Product Add-ons, Subscriptions and Composite Products.

**Product Bundles - Tabular Layout** is a Product Bundles plugin that adds a new "Layout" option to your Product Bundles. This can be used to activate a table-based layout, similar to the one found in Grouped Products. The Tabular layout results in a more effective UI when a bundle includes products with configurable quantities.

Developers may checkout and contribute to the plugin at its [GitHub Repository](http://github.com/somewherewarm/woocommerce-product-bundles-tabular-layout).
